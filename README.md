Sales Store Management System 

Project Overview
The Sales Store Management System is a database-driven project designed to efficiently store, manage, and analyze retail sales transactions within a store environment. This system centralizes customer data, product information, transactions, payments, and sales records, enabling accurate revenue tracking and data-driven business decision-making using SQL.
The project transforms raw transactional data into a normalized relational database structure to ensure consistency, integrity, and optimized query performance.

Business Problem
In many retail stores, sales data is stored in spreadsheets or raw formats, leading to:
1. Data duplication across product and customer records
2. Inconsistent transaction tracking
3. Difficulty analyzing revenue trends
4. Limited visibility into customer purchasing behavior
5. Inefficient reporting and delayed decision-making
Without a centralized relational database, retail operations become error-prone and inefficient.

Project Objectives
1. Design a structured relational database for retail sales management
2. Normalize raw transactional data into multiple relational tables
3. Maintain data integrity using primary keys and foreign key constraints
4. Convert raw date formats into structured SQL date/time types
5. Perform advanced SQL queries to extract business insights
6. Support revenue analysis, customer segmentation, and sales trend reporting

Database Design
The system follows a normalized relational database structure to ensure accuracy, eliminate redundancy, and maintain referential integrity.
Key Tables
1 Sales_Staging Table – Raw imported transaction dataset
2. Customers Table – Customer details (ID, Name, Age, Gender)
3. Products Table – Product details (ID, Name, Category, Price)
4. Transactions Table – Transaction metadata (Date, Time, Status)
5. Payments Table – Payment mode information
6. Transaction_Items Table – Product-level transaction records
Foreign key constraints were implemented to establish clear relationships between customers, transactions, products, and payments.

ER Diagram
The ER diagram defines structured relationships between customers, products, transactions, payments, and transaction items to:
1. Avoid data redundancy
2. Maintain referential integrity
3. Ensure accurate multi-table analysis
4. Support scalable database structure

Key SQL Analysis Questions
This project answers real-world retail analytics questions such as:
1. What is the total sales revenue generated by the store?
2. Which products generate the highest revenue?
3. Which product categories contribute most to overall sales?

Which customers purchase most frequently?

What is the average quantity sold per transaction?

Which payment mode is most preferred by customers?

How many transactions are completed, cancelled, or pending?

Which purchase hours show the highest sales activity?

Which age group generates the highest revenue?

Which customers contribute the highest total revenue?

What is the daily sales trend?

Which products show declining sales over time?

SQL Query Results & Insights
Using SQL concepts such as:
1. JOIN operations
2. GROUP BY & HAVING
3. Aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG)
4. Date & Time functions
5. CASE statements
6. Subqueries
The system generates meaningful insights related to:
1. Product-wise and category-wise revenue distribution
2. Customer purchasing behavior analysis
3. Payment mode contribution analysis
4. Daily and hourly sales trends
5. Revenue impact of cancelled transactions
6. Identification of high-value customers
7. Detection of declining product performance

Final Business Insights
1. Centralized retail data improves reporting efficiency
2. Product-level revenue analysis supports pricing optimization
3. Customer segmentation enables targeted marketing strategies
4. Time-based sales trends help optimize store operations
5. Payment pattern insights support financial planning
6. Data-driven decision-making enhances inventory and revenue management

Tools & Technologies
1. SQL – Database design and querying
2. MySQL (RDBMS)
3. ER Diagram – Database modeling
4. SQL Constraints – Primary Keys & Foreign Keys
5. Data Normalization Techniques

Project Outcome
This Sales Store Management System demonstrates how structured relational database design combined with advanced SQL analytics can:
1. Eliminate data redundancy
2. Improve revenue tracking accuracy
3. Enable detailed retail performance analysis
4. Support strategic business decisions
5. Enhance operational efficiency
It reflects strong understanding of relational database design, normalization, SQL querying, and real-world retail analytics workflows.
